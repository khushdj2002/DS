# Linked List

## A Linked List is an linear ds.

## Singly Linked List: A Singly Linked List is the most common type of Linked List. Each node has data and a pointer field containing an address to the next node.
## Doubly Linked List: A Doubly Linked List consists of an information field and two pointer fields. The information field contains the data. The first pointer field contains an address of the previous node, whereas another pointer field contains a reference to the next node. Thus, we can go in both directions (backward as well as forward).
## Circular Linked List: The Circular Linked List is similar to the Singly Linked List. The only key difference is that the last node contains the address of the first node, forming a circular loop in the Circular Linked List.
