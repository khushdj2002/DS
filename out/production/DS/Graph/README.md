# Graph

## Graph is an example of non linear ds comprising a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edge connecting them. 


# G = (V,E)

## The Graph ds, G is considered a mathematical structure comprised of a set of vertices, V and a set of Edges, E as shown below.

## The above figure represents a Graph having seven vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and ten edges [A, B], [A, C], [B, C], [B, D], [B, E], [C, D], [D, E], [D, F], [E, F], and [E, G].

# Depending upon the position of the vertices and edges, the Graphs can be classified into different types:

## Null Graph: A Graph with an empty set of edges is termed a Null Graph.
## Trivial Graph: A Graph having only one vertex is termed a Trivial Graph.
## Simple Graph: A Graph with neither self-loops nor multiple edges is known as a Simple Graph.
## Multi Graph: A Graph is said to be Multi if it consists of multiple edges but no self-loops.
## Pseudo Graph: A Graph with self-loops and multiple edges is termed a Pseudo Graph.
## Non-Directed Graph: A Graph consisting of non-directed edges is known as a Non-Directed Graph.
## Directed Graph: A Graph consisting of the directed edges between the vertices is known as a Directed Graph.
## Connected Graph: A Graph with at least a single path between every pair of vertices is termed a Connected Graph.
## Disconnected Graph: A Graph where there does not exist any path between at least one pair of vertices is termed a Disconnected Graph.
## Regular Graph: A Graph where all vertices have the same degree is termed a Regular Graph.
## Complete Graph: A Graph in which all vertices have an edge between every pair of vertices is known as a Complete Graph.
## Cycle Graph: A Graph is said to be a Cycle if it has at least three vertices and edges that form a cycle.
## Cyclic Graph: A Graph is said to be Cyclic if and only if at least one cycle exists.
## Acyclic Graph: A Graph having zero cycles is termed an Acyclic Graph.
## Finite Graph: A Graph with a finite number of vertices and edges is known as a Finite Graph.
## Infinite Graph: A Graph with an infinite number of vertices and edges is known as an Infinite Graph.
## Bipartite Graph: A Graph where the vertices can be divided into independent sets A and B, and all the vertices of set A should only be connected to the vertices present in set B with some edges is termed a Bipartite Graph.
## Planar Graph: A Graph is said to be a Planar if we can draw it in a single plane with two edges intersecting each other.
## Euler Graph: A Graph is said to be Euler if and only if all the vertices are even degrees.
## Hamiltonian Graph: A Connected Graph consisting of a Hamiltonian circuit is known as a Hamiltonian Graph.
